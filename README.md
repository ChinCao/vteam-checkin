## Overview

Silencio - Checkin is a Next.js application designed to manage user authentication and concert check-in processes. It leverages `next-auth` for authentication and uses local storage to manage user login status messages.

## Functionality

### Authentication and Sign-out

The application uses `next-auth/react` for handling user authentication. The `signOut` function is used across various components to log users out and redirect them to the sign-in page.

### User Feedback

The application provides feedback to users based on different scenarios related to concert check-ins. This feedback is stored in the browser's local storage under the key `loginStatus`. Here are the different scenarios:

1. **Invalid Email Link**: If the email link does not exist, the user is notified with the message "Email li√™n k·∫øt kh√¥ng t·ªìn t·∫°i" and is signed out.

2. **No Concert Ticket**: If a user attempts to check in without a concert ticket, they receive the message "Xin l·ªói, nh∆∞ng v√© c·ªßa b·∫°n kh√¥ng c√≥ concert!" and are signed out.

3. **Successful Concert Check-in**: Upon successful check-in, users are greeted with "Ch√∫c b·∫°n c√≥ 1 ƒë√™m concert th·∫≠t n·ªìng ch√°y üî•" and are signed out.

4. **Re-login Required**: If re-login is necessary for concert check-in, users see "B·∫°n h√£y login l·∫°i ƒë·ªÉ check-in concert" and are signed out.

5. **Check-in Reminder**: Users who have purchased specific ticket types are reminded to check in at a specified time with the message "H√£y quay l·∫°i check-in concert b·∫±ng website n√†y v√†o l√∫c 19:30 n·∫øu b·∫°n ƒë√£ mua h·∫°ng v√© B·∫ßu!" and are signed out.

### Code Structure

Each scenario is encapsulated in a separate component within the `src/app/(signout)` directory. These components use the `useEffect` hook to set the login status message and trigger the sign-out process.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and building the application.
- **next-auth**: For handling authentication processes.
- **React**: For building user interfaces.
